# EXAMPLE: Deploying Terraform Enterprise in Active/Active Mode

## About This Example

[Active/Active](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/before-installing/reference-architecture/gcp.html#active-active-implementation-mode) is an extension of Standalone mode that adds multiple active node capability that can expand horizontally to support larger and increasing execution loads. The same application runs on multiple Terraform Enterprise instances utilizing the same external services in a shared model.

## How to Use This Module

To run this module with an Active/Active configuration, increase the the `node_count` input to a value greater than 1.

The module will provide all other resources necessary for an Active/Active configuration.

Create a Terraform configuration that pulls in this module and specifies values of the required variables:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "<your GCP project>"
  region  = "<your GCP region>"
}

provider "google-beta" {
  project = "<your GCP project>"
  region  = "<your GCP region>"
}

module "tfe_node" {
  source               = "git@github.com:hashicorp/espd-tfe-gcp.git"
  namespace            = "<Namespace to uniquely identify resources>"
  node_count           = "<Number of TFE nodes to provision>"
  tfe_license_path     = "<Local path to the TFE license>"
  tfe_license_name     = "<Name of the license>"
  fqdn                 = "<Fully qualified domain name>"
  ssl_certificate_name = "<Name of the SSL certificate provisioned in GCP>"
  dns_zone_name        = "<Name of the DNS zone in which a record set will be created>"
}
```

- Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

## Required inputs

`namespace` - Namespace to uniquely identify resources. Used in name prefixes

`tfe_license_path` - Local path to the TFE license

`tfe_license_name` - Name of the license

`fqdn` - Fully qualified domain name

`ssl_certificate_name` - Name of the SSL certificate provisioned in GCP

`node_count` - Number of TFE nodes to provision. A number greater than 1 will enable Active/Active

`dns_zone_name` - Name of the DNS zone in which a record set will be created
