# EXAMPLE: Using this module with a SharedVPC

## About This Example

This is the same as the existing network example except it is provisioned into a VPC in a host project.

## How to Use This Module

- Read the entire README.md for the [main module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-terraform-enterprise).
- Ensure your Google credentials are set correctly
- Add Google Terraform provider blocks for both the `google` and `google-beta` providers as detailed [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference) to a file in this directory ending with `.tf`.
- Create a local `terraform.auto.tfvars` file and instantiate the required inputs as listed in the next section.
- The SharedVPC is up to the user to configure appropriately for the TFE deployment. Documentation on setting up a SharedVPC can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/provisioning-shared-vpc). The SharedVPC needs to be configured in the host project, and the service user must have permissions to create resources on the host project from the service project.
- For network configuration, refer to the [existing-network example](../existing-network).
- Create a Terraform configuration that pulls in this module and specifies values of the required variables:

```hcl
module "tfe_node" {
  source               = "git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-google-terraform-enterprise.git"
  namespace            = "<Namespace to uniquely identify resources>"
  node_count           = "<Number of TFE nodes to provision>"
  license_secret       = "<Secret Manager secret comprising license>
  fqdn                 = "<Fully qualified domain name>"
  ssl_certificate_name = "<Name of the SSL certificate provisioned in GCP>"
  dns_zone_name        = "<Name of the DNS zone in which a record set will be created>"
  network              = "<The self link of the host project's network to use>"
  subnetwork           = "<The self link of the host project's subnetwork to use>"
}
```

- Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply`

## Required inputs

`namespace` - Namespace to uniquely identify resources. Used in name prefixes

`license_file` - The local path to the Terraform Enterprise license

`fqdn` - Fully qualified domain name

`ssl_certificate_name` - Name of the SSL certificate provisioned in GCP. See below.

`node_count` - Number of TFE nodes to provision. A number greater than 1 will enable Active/Active

`dns_zone_name` - Name of the DNS zone in which a record set will be created

`network` - The self link of the host project's network to use

`subnetwork` - The self link of the host project's subnetwork to use

## Certificate Advice

- If you are deploying an instance with a private load balancer, the certificate needs to be a *regional* certificate. If you have a working certificate, you can upload this to GCP using the gcloud CLI command using the example below.

```bash
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create my-cert --certificate=fullchain.pem --private-key=privkey.pem --region=us-central1
```
where `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` are paths to local files containing the relevant certificate material. Specify the region where you intend to deploy Terraform Enterprise. Note that these certificates will not be listed in the GCP UI, but are visible if you run
```bash
gcloud compute ssl-certificates list
```

- If you are deploying a public instance of TFE, the certificate should be a global certificate.  Global certificates can be uploaded through the GCP UI (Network services > Load balancing > select advanced menu > Certificates > CREATE SSL CERTIFICATE) and will be visible both in the UI and also via the use of the above `gcloud` command.

## Post-deployment Tasks

- The build should take approximately 10-15 to deploy.  Once Terraform completes, give the platform another 10 minutes or so prior to attempting to interact with it in order for all containers to start up.
- Unless amended, this example will not create an initial admin user using the IACT, but does output the URL for convenience. Follow the advice in [this document](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/install/automating-initial-user.html) in order to create the initial admin user, and login to the system using this user in order to configure it for use.
